    <h1> New York AirBnB Price Analysis</h1>

    <h3>Introduction:</h3>

    <p>Airbnb is on the rise. It is increasingly being turned to for travel bookings compared to traditional hotel options.
        College students often use the company to plan trips with friends and try to cut down on travel costs.
        As college students ourselves, we were interested in what contributes to the varying prices of different houses advertised on AirBnB.
        Why is one house much more expensive than another house? What specific characteristics of the house may be the cause of it's higher price?
        This lead to the creation of the following data visualizations to explore this topic and see if anything could be uncovered from AirBinB data from New York.

            <p> As seen in this graph, from <a href="https://www.statista.com/chart/23520/number-of-nights-and-experiences-booked-on-airbnb/">Statista.com</a>
                AirBnB bookings have recovered from the pandemic and is generally on an upward trend from year to year.

    <p>The data we used was found on Kaggle, but was originally from AirBnB itself. There were originally 102,599 data points in the dataframe and 26 different attributes.
        We took a random sample of 3,000 of these houses to anaylsis further. A couple Nan values were filled in with the column average. The characteristics we specifically 
        explored are shown below:

        <h3>Overview of the Airbnb Listings:</h3>

        <div class = 'text'>
                <p> This is an interactive map showing the different neighborhood groups (boroughs) in New York City and the prices of the airbnbs from
                    the dataset. The map shows the names of the airbnbs as well as the attributes 'neighborhood group','neighborhood', 'price', 'service 
                    fee', 'room type', 'construction year', and 'review rate number'. From this map, there are significantly more airbnbs located in 
                    Manhattan that the rest of the boroughs. Throughout each of the boroughs, the prices flucuate as there are no specific clusters where
                    there are airbnbs that are vastly more expensive than others.

            <div class = 'text'>
                <p> This is a side-by-side boxplot that displays the distribution of airbnb review rates. The review rates are on a scale from 1 to 5.
                    With the exception of the airbnbs rated 1 out of 5, all of the values (2-5) have a median price of at least $600. The airbnb with
                    the highest price is rated 3 out of 5 and costs $1199 per night.The rating with the largest interquartile range and the most variety
                    of prices 2 out of 5, which has an interquartile range of 589. Consquently, the review rate does not determine how expensive an airbnb
                    costs. 
                </p>
            </div>

        <div class = 'text'></div>
            <div class = 'text'>
                <p> This scatterplot illustrates the relationship between an Airbnb's price and the type of room that someone can book, which can be a
                    an entire home or apartment, hotel room, private room, or shared room. Each of these values vary with the price. There are only 3 
                    data points that are hotels, which tend to be cheaper per night than the other rooms. The most expensive hotel is $751 per night and 
                    the least expensive is $164 per night. The two least expensive spaces are both $50 per night, which are an entire home and a
                    private room respectively. As a result, the type of room a person books does not necessarily determine how expensive it is.

        </div>

        <p>
           This side-by-side boxplot shows the daily rental price across different construction year groups.
           All of the houses were built post 2000, and are seperated into five buckets. Most of the boxes have means just over 600, 
           while the newest houses have a slightly higher average closer to 700. However, it is not a big enough difference to have 
           any real statitsical significanse. All of the boxes have a larger amount of overlap. They all range from around 50 dollars 
           a night to 1200 dollars a night. This shows that how old or new a house/apartment is does not contribution to its rental price
           and both expensive and more budget friendly options can be found across any contruction year group. 
        </p>

        <p>We have also created a scatter plot to compare how price relates to the booking availibitly of the house. 
        </p>

        <div class = 'center'>
            <iframe src="index_scatterplot.html" width="85%" height="550px" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        </div>

        <p>
            This scatterplot shows the relationship between daily rental price and availibitly over the next year, i.e. next 365 days. 
            The houses are relateively evenly spread out across the graph, but it is less dense in the middle. There are two clear lines at 
            365 days and 0 days, meaning most houses are either completely booked or completely free. 

        </p>
 
        <div class = 'center'>
            <iframe src="neighborhood_averages.html" width="100%" height="600px"></iframe>
        </div>

            <p>
                This interactive bar plot showcases the averages prices of Airbnbs in each neighborhood of New York City. The highest average prices
                of rooms are in Brooklyn, while the lowest average price is in Queens. The most expensive room in Brooklyn in $1135 per nigh and the 
                cheapest room in Queens is $59 per night. It is worth noting that there are significantly less Airbnbs located in neighborhoods of 
                Staten Island (7), than the other groups, which have at least 20 different neighborhoods. Therefore, there is more variation in the
                prices where there are more neighborhoods included.
            </p>

        <h3>Conclusion:</h3>

        <p>
            In this visualization analysis, we try to explore the factors that could 
            influence the rental price of a AirBnB booking. We also how looked at how booked up the range of 
            prices were. The main finding was that neighborhood is the most important factor in how expensive a booking will be.
            Thus, when making travel plans the most important varaible for one's budgeting is to decide where they are going, which neighborhood
            they want to stay in, and how important it is to them that thei accomadations are close to where they will spend time during the day.
            With this insight, airbnb bookings can be made with greater knowledge and prowess. 

        </p>
        <p>
            Since this data is only from New York it cannot be generalised to the rest of the country. 
            There is still additional work needed to truly uncover the differences in rental prices, such as the difference between houses in the same neighborhood, but this portfolio 
            provides a solid ground work.
