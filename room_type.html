We know this will be a major turn-off to many people, but we believe we can find a like-minded roommate who can have fun outside the house.  5. If you are not sure about your check-out date, you can reserve the minimum days and extend your stay at a discounted rate.  6. Check-in time has to be coordinated at least 48 hours ahead.

For security measures we require all guests to provide proof of identification through ID verification on our own website. In order to check in, we'll need a photo of your ID.  5. Don\u2019t let $300 go up in smoke. There's no smoking allowed in any Flatbook and a $300 fine for breaking this rule.  6. Unfortunately we don\u2019t allow pets in most of our apartments. 7. Unless you\u2019re staying in one of our specialty apartments, we don\u2019t allow parties or excessive noise. 8.
